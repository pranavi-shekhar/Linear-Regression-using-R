# Multiple Linear Regression using R

- The aim of this work is to explore, model and make predictions based on the Movies data set comprising of 651 randomly sampled movies produced and released before 2016.
- The data set used is **movies.RData**, also included here. A codebook describing all the attributes in the data set is also avaialble.
- The Checklist provided was originally the project rubric for the submission, but the structure is useful to provide a logical flow to the process. It is a useful reference and has hence been added.
- The R Scipt contains all the codes used in this work. The  **reg_model_project** files contain detailed explanations of the code and approach. A **HTML** and **RMarkdown** version of the documentation is provided.
- The complete documentation, with all the code used, can also be found here : https://rpubs.com/pranavi/652746
